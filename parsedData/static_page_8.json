\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n                        OverviewThe H-1B program applies to employers seeking to hire nonimmigrant aliens as workers in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability. A specialty occupation is one that requires the application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent. The intent of the H-1B provisions is to help employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce by authorizing the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorized to work in the United States.The law establishes certain standards in order to protect similarly employed U.S. workers from being adversely affected by the employment of the nonimmigrant workers, as well as to protect the H-1B nonimmigrant workers. Employers must attest to the Department of Labor that they will pay wages to the H-1B nonimmigrant workers that are at least equal to the actual wage paid by the employer to other workers with similar experience and qualifications for the job in question, or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended employment – whichever is greater.Key NewsOn January 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor (Department) issued an Office of Foreign Labor Certification H-1B Program Bulletin and a Wage and Hour Division Field Assistance Bulletin (FAB) revising its interpretation of its regulations concerning which employers of H-1B workers must file Labor Condition Applications.  The Department simultaneously submitted a Notice for publication in the Federal Register announcing and requesting public comments on this interpretation.  On January 20, 2021, the Department withdrew its Notice from the Office of the Federal Register prior to its publication, and is now withdrawing the Bulletin and FAB for the purpose of considering the process for issuing this interpretation as well as reviewing related issues of law, fact, and policy.  Accordingly, the requirements of the Bulletin and FAB are no longer in effect.  The Department will notify the public of any further actions as appropriate once it completes its review. General GuidanceField Assistance Bulletin 2019-3: Compliance with the H-1B Notice Requirement by Electronic Posting (PDF)Employment Law Guide: Workers in Professional and Specialty Occupations (H-1B and H-1B1 Visas)Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Prevailing Wage Determinations for Nonagricultural ProgramsWages under Foreign Labor CertificationH-1B Workers Rights CardH-1B PresentationThe Employment of Non-Immigrants on H-1B Visas (Microsoft® PowerPoint®)FormsNew Labor Condition Application (Form ETA 9035) with InstructionsWH-4, H-1B Nonimmigrant Information FormFact SheetsH-1B Fact Sheets - Numerical IndexDisqualified and Willful Violator EmployersDOL maintains a list of individuals or corporations who, as a result of an H-1B investigation/final agency action, have been disqualified from approval of petitions to participate in the nonimmigrant program.
